# AutoInstall
Program to automatically run installers! Does this by running all MSIs that share it's  directory. Then just press 1 or 2 to have a reboot at the end or not.

EXE installers are also supported, except those usually have more particular options needed to run silently so they must be optionally turned on in the 'settings.txt' file.
(P.S. The settings file gets regenerated if it doesn't exist, so don't worry too much about the default one.)
